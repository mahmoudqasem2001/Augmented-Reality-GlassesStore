## Overview

This repository contains a glasses store application with a virtual try-on feature, aiming to revolutionize the eyewear shopping experience. The application utilizes Flutter for the mobile app, Spring Boot with PostgreSQL for the REST API, and Unity 3D with AR Foundation for the virtual try-on functionality.

Through a user-friendly interface, customers can browse and virtually try on glasses in real-time, providing a more accurate and engaging shopping experience. The application focuses on usability, accuracy, performance, and security, and envisions future expansion to a global market and exploration of alternative low-level AR services.

## Features

- 	An ability for users to browse and filter glasses by various criteria, such as type, brand, price, border, gender, or color.
- 	An ability for users to view detailed product information for each pair of glasses, including photos, descriptions, and technical specifications.
- 	An ability for users to browse, and to view detailed product information for each pair of glasses.

- 	An ability for the application to process the order, and to confirm the order details and total cost to the user.
- 	An ability for the user to confirm their order before submitting it.
 These are just a few examples of functional requirements that might be relevant for the flow of orders and checkout in the project.
